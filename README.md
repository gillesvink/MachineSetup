# MachineSetup
Personal scripts to setup machines automated. Not meant for usage other than me. This is a public repo so I can set-up the machine without having to login first. (As things like my public ssh key are installed on the machine.)

```bash
sudo bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gillesvink/MachineSetup/main/alma_9.sh)
```
